# Code Your Transcript

Read through your transcript and code cells by entering words from our controlled vocabulary into the "tags" column, adjacent to the specific cell you want those tags to describe.

**Rules for Entering Tags:**
- For consistency, keep tags lowercase
- Multi-word tags must be hyphenated (`data-sequencing`)
- To insert multiple tags, include a semi-colon between each tag with no spaces (`data-sequencing;genetics`)
